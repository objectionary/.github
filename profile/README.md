Here are the components around [EO](https://www.eolang.org) programming language and
the [ùúë-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384) it's based on, including:

  * [/eo](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eo) is a canonical transpiler of EO programs to Java (start here!)
  * [/sandbox](https://github.com/objectionary/sandbox) is where you can play with a ready-to-use simple EO program
  * [/eo-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/eo-intellij-plugin) is EO plugin for JetBrains IDEs
  * [/eoc](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eoc) is a command line toolkit for compiling and running EO programs
  * [/home](https://www.github.com/objectionary/home) is where we keep EO sources of all "canonical" objects
  * [/try-phi](https://github.com/objectionary/try-phi) is an online interpreter of ùúë-calculus expressions
