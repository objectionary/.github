Here we keep most important components of the ecosystem around [EO](https://www.eolang.org) programming language and
the [ùúë-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384) it's based on, including:

  * [/eo](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eo) is a canonical transpiler of EO programs to Java (start here!)
  * [/sandbox](https://github.com/objectionary/sandbox) is where you can play with a ready-to-use simple EO program
  * [/eoc](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eoc) is a command line toolkit for compiling and running EO programs
  * [/home](https://www.github.com/objectionary/home) is where we keep EO sources of all "standard" objects
  * [/try-phi](https://github.com/objectionary/try-phi) is an online interpreter of ùúë-calculus expressions

By the way, we still don't have these modules and expect you to contribute:

  * EO to [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture)/[x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) compiler (maybe as [GCC frontend](https://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html))
  * EO plugin for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA)
  * EO [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) interface
  * EO to Ruby/JavaScript/Go/PHP compilers
  * EO to Java bridge, allowing Java objects to "live" inside EO programs
  * ARM/x86 to EO "decompiler"
