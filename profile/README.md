Here we keep all components of the ecosystem around EO programming language and ùúë-calculus:

  * [objectionary/eoc](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eoc) is a command line toolkit, start with it!
  * [objectionary/home](https://www.github.com/objectionary/home) is where we keep EO sources of all "standard" objects
  * [objectionary/eo-parser](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eo-parser) is a parser of .eo files to .xmir

We need contributors! Join [our group](https://t.me/polystat_org) in Telegram, we'll discuss.
