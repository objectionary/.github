Here we keep all components of the ecosystem around EO programming language and 𝜑-calculus:

  * [eoc](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eoc) --- a command line toolkit, start with it!
  * [eo-parser](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eo-parser) --- is a parser of .eo files to .xmir

We need contributors! Join [our group](https://t.me/polystat_org) in Telegram, we'll discuss.
