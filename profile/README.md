Here we keep all components of the ecosystem around [EO](https://www.eolang.org) programming language and
[ùúë-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384):

  * [/eoc](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eoc) is a command line toolkit, start with it!
  * [/home](https://www.github.com/objectionary/home) is where we keep EO sources of all "standard" objects
  * [/eo](https://www.github.com/objectionary/eo) is a canonical transpiler of EO programs to Java

We still don't have these modules:

  * EO to [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture)/[x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) compiler (maybe as [GCC frontend](https://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html))
  * EO plugin for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA)
  * EO [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) interface
  * EO to Ruby/JavaScript/Go/PHP compilers
  * EO to Java bridge, allowing Java objects to "live" inside EO programs
  * ARM/x86 to EO "decompiler"

We need contributors! Join [our group](https://t.me/polystat_org) in Telegram, we'll discuss.
